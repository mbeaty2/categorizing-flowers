# Categorizing Flowers

This project writes from scratch a simple neural network to categorize flowers. 

## Description

This project uses a dataset of flower images, labels, and category names to train a simple neural network classifying the flower images with their predicted category name. The project utilizes a flower dataset and category name dataset made available open-source via the Python for AI Udacity nanodegree program. Though, the framework of the neural network should support other types of datasets. This repository contains all necessary files to write and train your own model, including the train.py, which trains a model; predict.py, which predicts flower categories; and functions.py, which holds all required functions for the other files to successfully run. As noted, this model is incredibly simple and only took about 3 epochs at a learning rate of 0.01 to reach a 73% accuracy rate. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The foundation of this project is within tensorflow. A keras compatible engine is required.
* This project utilized a 16GB GPU.
* Refer to the train.py file to check software and package dependencies. 

### Installing

* Access and download a dataset of your choosing.
* Review and manipulate the neural network and functions found within this repository to fit your specifications, dataset, and goals for the neural network.
* Ensure your system has installed the required dependencies to run the model.

### Executing program

* Download the necessary datasets. 
* Download the .py files
* Open a terminal and locate where the downloaded datasets and files are on your local machine.
* Create a new environment and call the model in directly in the terminal.

## Help

The most common problem I encountered was run-time lengths and accuracy inconsistencies. What I found helpful resolving these issues was to reduce the epoch size, the training set size, or the batch size.
